Essential Freshwater
================

On 5 August 2020, central government gazetted a new "Essential Freshwater" package of regulatory instruments designed to "stop further degradation of freshwater" and "improve water quality within five years". The package included a new National Policy Statement for Freshwater Management (NPS-FM 2020), new National Environmental Standards for Freshwater (NES-F) and Stock Exclusion Regulations. All three instruments came into force on 3 September 2020. 

This repository contains scripts related to the ECan science work on the "Essential Freshwater" instrument.
